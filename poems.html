			<h3>Lujane, my angel</h3>
			<br>
			<p>This year for valentine I won't give you a physical gift</p>
			<p>It's because of our distance, aah it feels like such a rift</p>
			<p>I love you, and here's 24 reasons why</p>
			<p>This won't be a good poem, but at least I try:</p>
			<br>
			<p>You have the nicest hair,</p>
			<p>I want to move my fingers through it, this just isn't fair</p>
			<p>You have the most mesmerizing eyes</p>
			<p>I told you I get lost in them, these aren't lies</p>
			<br>
			<p>You have the cutest nose,</p>
			<p>I want to slightly touch it with mine and feel you close</p>
			<p>You have the softest lips,</p>
			<p>I can't wait to press them against mine on our trips</p>
			<br>
			<p>To hear your cute laugh brings me such joy</p>
			<p>That I get to witness that, God I'm a lucky boy</p>
			<p>You have the prettiest smile,</p>
			<p>Keep it on your face is priority #1, by a mile</p>
			<br>
			<p>Your Angelic voice, it’s what made me fall in love</p>
			<p>To hear it every day, it must be gift from above</p>
			<p>To be so genuine, you're truly amazing in that regard,</p>
			<p>It's a pleasure to have a place in your heart</p>
			<br>
			<p>You truly have a fascinating mind,</p>
			<p>1 thing I want, is for yours and mine to be intertwined</p>
			<p>You are really smart,</p>
			<p>if you really tried you could top the charts</p>
			<br>
			<p>You're exciting about your passions and it shows</p>
			<p>To hear the excitement in voice, oh I want you close</p>
			<p>Making me laugh is your expertise</p>
			<p>After you tell a joke, I sound like a lack of monkeys</p>
			<br>
			<p>You understand me on such a deep and intimate way</p>
			<p>I feel safe enough to tell you anything right away</p>
			<p>You are so courageous with your feelings</p>
			<p>It makes my love for you jumps through ceilings</p>
			<br>
			<p>You taught me how amazing it feels to be weak</p>
			<p>I love you so much I want to kiss you next to a creek</p>
			<p>You let me be my cheesy self and appreciate it</p>
			<p>I hope you accept all the love I emit</p>
			<br>
			<p>You are genuinely interested in what I have to say,</p>
			<p>Forever, is how long I want you to stay</p>
			<p>You encourage me to face my fears</p>
			<p>I appreciate you, I want to whisper that in your ears</p>
			<br>
			<p>Whenever you say something cute, I lose control</p>
			<p>Join me in the woods, we'll go for a pleasant stroll</p>
			<p>You and me think 100% alike</p>
			<p>Come with me to the beach, I'll kiss you on a dike</p>
			<br>
			<p>You fill me with butterflies every morning</p>
			<p>Without your messages my life is quite boring</p>
			<p>You make me go to sleep feeling safe and happy</p>
			<p>On days that without you I'd consider crappy</p>
			<br>
			<p>You appreciate everything that makes me me</p>
			<p>I just want to cuddle with you, drinking a cup of tea</p>
			<p>You always surprise me with ur overwhelming love,</p>
			<p>This is definitely intervention from above</p>

            <br>
            <p>My sweetest and dearest,</p>
            <p>My lovely Lujane</p>
            <p>I crave to be your armrest</p>
            <p>I’d love for you to rest against me in every train</p>
            <br>
            <p>The time we spent together, it was truly magical</p>
            <p>It meant so much to me, I can’t wait to redo it</p>
            <p>I love you so much it exceeds all bounds it’s irrational</p>
            <p>I truly hope this is the last time we have to split</p>
            <br>
            <p>I just need to be with you I have to be by your side</p>
            <p>All I care about is us being together</p>
            <p>I don’t care where it is, my limits are worldwide</p>
            <p>All i need is for it to last forever</p>
            <br>
            <p>I look forward to our first cute, cosy house</p>
            <p>Decorating it with you is a daydream of mine</p>
            <p>You make me so damn happy and that deserves an applause</p>
            <p>I can’t wait to have our first night in there and have our legs intertwine</p>
            <br>
            <p>With you, my love, I want to grow old</p>
            <p>I know I’ll never have regrets</p>
            <p>I want to protect you from the cold</p>
            <p>No matter how bad it gets</p>
            <br>
            <p>For you I’d do anything, just ask</p>
            <p>Be careful with this power, however</p>
            <p>Don’t encourage me to do reckless tasks</p>
            <p>That wouldn’t be very clever</p>
            <br>
            <p>But to show you my love is my greatest desire</p>
            <p>I want nothing rather</p>
            <p>Than to be ur happiness supplier</p>
            <p>Or whatever you require</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love you my honey</p>
            <p>I’ll miss you so much, being with you is so much more important than my degree</p>
            <p>My love is so strong, it’s unexplainable, it’s uncanny</p>
            <p>I need u so badly, please come back to me</p>

            <h3>Writing poems</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Writing poems, for me, is really tough</p>
            <p>But I’d do anything for you,  my love</p>
            <p>The last time I wrote one, I only had 1 picture of your face</p>
            <p>As soon as I saw your face on camera, you made my heart race</p>
			<br>
            <p>Since then, I’ve had a lot more to go on,</p>
            <p>That’s why I’m writing you another poem</p>
            <p>I really hope this is ready by the time we get to paris</p>
            <p>So I can stare at you while you read it, right into your iris</p>
			<br>
            <p>Now, time to get into the good stuff,</p>
            <p>Aaaaah, just the thought of you! I can’t get enough</p>
            <p>To keep my hands of you, you’ll need to restrain me with a belt</p>
            <p>Your smile alone makes me melt</p>
			<br>
            <p>I’ve said it before but your hair is truly amazing</p>
            <p>Whatever you say, I will keep on praising</p>
            <p>You may find me saying it weird, but your nose is so goddamn cute</p>
            <p>There really isn’t a greater substitute</p>
			<br>
            <p>Anything you do turns me on,</p>
            <p>From just talking about your day, to discussing our future son</p>
            <p>You are the kindest most caring person alive</p>
            <p>I get smothered with so much of your love it’s like I’m five</p>
			<br>
            <p>I love you so much my baby,</p>
            <p>You make my heart go crazy</p>
            <p>The best part of my day isn’t good stuff happening to me but let me give you a clue</p>
            <p>The thing that makes me the happiest is sharing this stuff with you!</p>
			<br>
            <p>I hope you never doubt my love because it’s always there,</p>
            <p>Even if you can’t directly feel it in the air</p>
            <p>You truly are way too good for me</p>
            <p>I think about that fact constantly</p>
			<br>
            <p>You have so much patience with everything</p>
            <p>I sure hope I am improving</p>
            <p>Because your happiness is the sole thing I pursue</p>
            <p>Lujane, I love you!</p>

            <h3>My dearest and sweetest honey</h3>
            <br>
			<p>My dearest and sweetest honey</p>
			<p>I’m sorry I hurt you</p>
			<p>Give me a chance to make it up to you, just any</p>
			<p>I love you, through and through</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have made terrible mistakes</p>
			<p>I regret them so much</p>
			<p>My heart really aches</p>
			<p>It feels like a knife to the heart, or a powerful punch</p>
			<br>
			<p>Normally I have you, to ease off the pain</p>
			<p>With your beautiful voice, angelic and soft</p>
			<p>But instead i’m all alone in the rain</p>
			<p>My throat has gone dry all I can do is cough</p>
			<br>
			<p>To Make it up to you, I’m crafting a plan</p>
			<p>For you, I’ll jump through hoop after hoop</p>
			<p>If only to see your face again</p>
			<p>Even if that means just running in a loop</p>
			<br>
			<p>I need you with me forever</p>
			<p>Losing you would be hell on earth</p>
			<p>But the past 6 months have been the best ever,</p>
			<p>from now going back all the way to my birth</p>
			<br>
			<p>Talking to you is the best part of my day</p>
			<p>I can’t live without my angel</p>
			<p>And I know that’s cliche</p>
			<p>Without you my mind’s in a complete tangle</p>
			<br>
			<p>Whatever happens my love for you will never fade</p>
			<p>I will owe you forever</p>
			<p>Or until you say my debt has been repaid</p>
			<p>I truly hope you decide for us to stay together</p>
			<br>
			<p>My honey, my sweetheart</p>
			<p>I love you so passionately</p>
			<p>From an angel no one could tell you apart</p>
			<p>Please stay with me</p>
